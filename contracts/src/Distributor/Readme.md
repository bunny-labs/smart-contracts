# `Distributor.sol`

## Overview

`Distributor.sol` is a contract for dispersing an ERC20 token from one address to a fixed number of membership NFT owners.
Each membership in the distribution is represented by an ERC721 NFT and has a weight associated to it.
Holders receive ERC20 tokens proportionally to the weight their membership has.
Each NFT is fully on-chain with JSON metadata and an SVG image asset generated by the smart contract.

## How to use

1. Approve `Distributor` to move the ERC20 token from the `source` address.
   - Call `approve(<your distributor contract address>, <approval limit>)` of the token contract from your `source` wallet.
   - Needs to be done once per ERC20 token.
2. Call `distribute(<asset address>, <source address>)` of your `Distributor` contract.
   - Takes the balance of the ERC20 token in `source` wallet and distributes it proportionally to all membership token holders.
