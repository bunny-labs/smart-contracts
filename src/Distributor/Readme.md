# `Distributor`

## Overview

`Distributor` is a contract for sending tokens to a fixed number of memberships based on predetermined proportions.

Each membership in the distribution is represented by an ERC721 NFT and has a number of shares associated to it.
Holders receive ERC20 tokens proportionally to the shares their membership has.
Ex: a membership with 5k shares in a distribution with 245k total shares will receive ~2.04% of any tokens distributed.

These membership NFTs are minted when a new distribution contract is created and they cannot be changed later.
Each NFT is fully on-chain with JSON metadata and an SVG image asset generated by the smart contract.

You can create new distributions and distribute tokens using the frontend at [distributor.bunnylabs.studio](https://distributor.bunnylabs.studio).
